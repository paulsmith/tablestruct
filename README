tablestruct
===========

Maps Go structs to database tables, struct fields to columns.

Uses code generation.

Maintain a metadata file that contains the mappings. This file can be initially
created by inspecting an existing database or set of tables.

Generated Go code should not be checked in to version control. The generation
step should be included as part of a build process.
